00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.900
Wow,

2
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.900
what an audience.

3
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.900
But if I'm being honest, I don't care what you think of my talk.

4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:18.900
I don't.

5
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.900
I care what the internet thinks of my talk.

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:21.900
(Laughter)

7
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.900
Because they are the ones who get it seen and shared.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.900
And I think that's where most people get it wrong.

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.900
They're talking to you, here,

10
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.900
instead of talking to you, random person scrolling Facebook.

11
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.900
Thanks for the click.

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.200
You see, back in 2009,

13
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.900
we all had these weird little things called attention spans.

14
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.900
(Laughter)

15
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.900
Yeah, they're gone. They're gone. We killed them. They're dead.

16
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.900
I'm trying to think of the last time I watched an 18-minute TED talk.

17
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.900
It's been years, literally years.

18
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.900
So if you're giving a TED talk, keep it quick.

19
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.900
I'm doing mine in under a minute.

20
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.900
I'm at 44 seconds right now;

21
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.900
that means we've got time for one final joke.

22
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.900
Why are balloons so expensive?

23
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.900
(Audience) "Why?"

24
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.900
Woody Roseland: "Inflation"

25
00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.900
(Laughter)

26
00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.900
(Applause)
